# scopes that might be fun to implement
- current_user_top_tracks()
- current_user_top_artist()
- devices()

#TODO
- Make it that you can control the date of the graphs
- Make a graph like all songs ever played but than for artists to see how many times you have played an artist
- Make a graph that shows goes from the first time you played to song to the day you select and than shows how often you listened to it every day/week/month
	- Maybe make it so you can add multiple songs and give different lines so you can compare multiple songs
- Make a page with all songs i've played with link to the song on spotify, a 30 sec preview, all the artists that are in the song plus a link to their account and the song img
- Do the check for listening after like 10 seconds because then you can skip a song without it registering as played
- Make a readout for how many unique songs i have ever listened to
- Make a readout for how many unique songs i have listened to this day/week/month 
- Make a graph for how many songs i have listened in a day/week/month

#FOR THE VERY FAR FUTURE	
- Make it automatically make a queue based on the last X amount songs you played
- Show songs that you don't really like anymore
- Do this based on skips
- Add songs to all time best playlist
- Remove songs from all time best playlist
