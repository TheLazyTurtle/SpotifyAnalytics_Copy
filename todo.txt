# scopes that might be fun to implement
- current_user_top_tracks()
- current_user_top_artist()
- devices()

#TODO
- Maybe make it so you can add multiple songs and give different lines so you can compare multiple songs
- Make a page with all songs i've played with link to the song on spotify, a 30 sec preview, all the artists that are in the song plus a link to their account and the song img
- Make a readout for how many unique songs i have ever listened to
- Make a readout for how many unique songs i have listened to this day/week/month
